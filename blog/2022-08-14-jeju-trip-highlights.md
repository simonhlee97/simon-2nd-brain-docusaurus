Jeju has been our famliy's annual summer vacation spot for the past 4 years (except 2021 due to the pandemic). Here are some highlights from our trip. Due to my wife's xenophobia (towards foreigners), she does a really good job of finding restaurants and activities that aren't popular with expats and tourists but popular with locals. With that said, it's impossible to keep everything a secret in Jeju, as thousands of tourists every week continue revealing all the secret gems of Jeju.

### Jeju Circus World
A team of Chinese acrobats (1 girl group and 1 boy group) perform here. A blend of martial arts, gymnastics, acrobatic moves, and pop music. The final performance is a thrilling, high-risk motorcycle show inside a small spheric cage.

### Hyeopjae Beach
Across the street from Hallim Park, you'll find one of the larger and more popular beaches. All the a la carte services are available for moderately-priced fees (showers, snacks, fried chicken, beer, tube/tent/umbrella rentals, etc.). Parking is free, though it can be hard to find a spot due to the flood of tourists. You can also pay 50,000 Won to rent a gazebo, which comes with your own parking spot. The views, mild waves, and the early afternoon low tide offers plenty of mini-crabs (ÍΩÉÍ≤å) for children to catch and keep them busy.

### Group Fishing Tour from Ï∞®Í∑ÄÎèÑ Îã¨ÎûòÎ∞∞ÎÇöÏãú

I told my wife to find a fishing tour for the family, and she came through. We went to a place called Ï∞®Í∑ÄÎèÑ Îã¨ÎûòÎ∞∞ÎÇöÏãú. You should call and book a time slot 1 or 2 days before going, especially during summer and busy tourism seasons. The kids really enjoyed the experience, even though the fish outsmarted me that day and I was not able to catch anything.

Two nice blog posts written by Korean travelers about their experience with Ï∞®Í∑ÄÎèÑ Îã¨ÎûòÎ∞∞ÎÇöÏãú:

### Arte Museum
I actually didn't see the exhibit. My wife and kids went, and I waited in the Arte Shop (gift shop). The shop is a nice oppotunity to see Jeju, the Brand, as it contains a collection of Jeju-fied products - ranging from snacks, chocolates, ramen noodles, to t-shirts, toys, and office supplies. My wife told me the art collection inside was similar to the Chicago light displays at the Magnificent Mile, so I don't think I missed out on too much.

### Father's Garden (ÌååÎçîÏä§Í∞ÄÎì†)
This place had a little bit of art, lots of flowers and botanic gardens, and a small petting zoo where you can buy some carrots and let the kids feed some animals (though my kids preferred feeding the cute family of Shiba Inus).

### Best Pizza and Pasta on the Island 

Hard to find, located in a tight residential alley just a few miles east of the aforementioned beach, is a tiny pizza & pasta joint called ÏòπÌè¨83. Not only is it hard to find, with their limited hours and limited space (just 4 tables), if you don't arrive a few minutes before 5pm, you will almost certainly be waiting outside.

The pastry-crust pizza is amazing! Light, flaky, and fluffy croissant-like crust. The pasta and the rice dish were also crazy delicious.

### Best Donuts on the Island

Tiger Donut (Ï†úÏ£ºÌò∏Îû≠Ïù¥) should also be added to the UNESCO World Heritage list. The donuts are made in house and filled with crazy-delicious cream. I could not imagine leaving Jeju without having tried these donuts.

### Jeju Dongmun Market

If there's one traditional market worth visiting in Jeju, it would be the Dongmun Market. I could be wrong, but I believe it is the oldest on the island. With an awesome variety of delicious seafood and streetfood, you can find most of Jeju's famous and popular foods here.
