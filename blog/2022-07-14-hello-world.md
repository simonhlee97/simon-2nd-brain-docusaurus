Finally! I think I am finally happy with my little online world (aka blog). I think switching to [**Docusaurus**](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) was a big step and helps me in so many ways. Going forward, I think I'll be more excited to open up this project in VS Code and write blog posts, as well as add notes in my 2nd Brain.

### Previously

I had a _really_ basic Next.js blog set up. But it was too basic and uninspiring, which made it hard for me to add posts.

And then I discovered this 2nd Brain thing and wanted to see if I could turn it into a breathing project. So I made a basic 2nd Brain with something called DocPress.

But having my blog (simonpost.com) and the 2nd Brain in 2 separate repos left me bitter. So this latest project, using Docusaurus, is also an attempt to consolidate my blog and 2nd Brain into 1 Mono-Project!

Finally. I really hope I can focus on writing blog posts and adding short notes to my 2nd Brain.
