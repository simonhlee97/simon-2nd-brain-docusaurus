## About Simon's Second Brain + Public Learning Project

I take _Zero_ credit for coming up with the ideas. I'm just trying things out and learning from others.

For more on this "Second Brain" & "Public Learning" stuff, here are some links if you're interested:

* [swyx - Learning in Public guru](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
* [swyx's Second Brain page](https://publish.obsidian.md/swyx/README)
* [Tiago - Second Brain guru](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)
* [PARA System](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) (it's a method for organizing content, which I am kind of using. More below.)

### What is the PARA System?

**P** -> **Project** is “a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.”

Examples include: Complete app mockup; Develop project plan; Execute business development campaign; Write blog post; Finalize product specifications; Attend conference

**A** -> **Area of responsibility** is “a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.”

Examples include: Health; Finances, Professional Development; Travel; Hobbies; Friends; Apartment; Car; Productivity; Direct reports; Product Development; Writing

**R** -> **Resource** is “a topic or theme of ongoing interest.”

Examples include: habit formation; project management; transhumanism; coffee; music; gardening; online marketing; SEO; interior design; architecture; note-taking

**A** -> **Archives** include “inactive items from the other three categories.”

Examples include: projects that have been completed or become inactive; areas that you are no longer committed to maintaining; resources that you are no longer interested in
